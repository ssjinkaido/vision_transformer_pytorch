# vision_transformer_pytorch

The paper of vision transformer is here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929.pdf \
Most of the code are borrowed from here : https://github.com/YousefGamal220/Vision-Transformers \
I try to re-implement the multiheaded attention since the code I borrowed was weird, also I try to rewrite the train function to make it looks cleaner
